## Item #1: Default notes structure on account creation
- **Type**: ✨ Feature
- **Status**: 📝 PLANNED
- **Description**: Automatically create a default folder structure (daily, people, projects, etc.) when a new user account is created
- **Slug**: default-notes-structure
- **Plan**: .simplan/plans/1-default-notes-structure.md

## Item #2: Audio recording storage and transcription list
- **Type**: ✨ Feature
- **Status**: 📋 BACKLOG
- **Description**: Store audio recordings on-device and list them in a dedicated audio/transcription screen (replacing the "recents" menu). Audio files should be listed with their transcriptions. The current behavior of writing transcriptions directly into notes is incorrect — only detailed summaries should go into notes (to be implemented later).
- **Slug**: audio-storage-transcription
- **Plan**: None
